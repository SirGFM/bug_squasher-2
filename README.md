# bug_squasher-2

New version of 'Bug Squasher', to test "new" remade library: GFraMe v2.

## Requirements

This game requires that SDL2 and GFraMe are installed on your computer. SDL2 can be
downloaded here (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), while GFraMe can be
downloaded here (https://github.com/SirGFM/GFraMe/tree/devel).

After cloning/downloading the GFraMe source, simply run `make release` to compile and
install it. Though the project can be succesfully compiled on Windows, the "install" rule
still doesn't work on Windows (I'll look on that as soon as I start developing this game).

Also, although I intend to build an Android version, I'm still not quite sure about how I'm
going to automatize the building.
